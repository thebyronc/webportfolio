          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>Univserity of Oregon graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Mulitimedia Design</p>
          <p>I have worked as a Instructional Designer for the past 3 years in my career. With a strong consulting background I can very quickly join your team and immediately start providing value to you and your organization. Combining project management, design, and training skills I will make sure the gaps in a corporate workflow are identified and filled.</p>
          <p>Personally, I spend a lot of time with my wife and dog. I also partake in martial arts, in which I haven been practicing for the past 10 years of my life. I regularly go around Portland performing for different events. Quite a few of them are for schools that want to bring in different cultures to their school assemblies.</p>
